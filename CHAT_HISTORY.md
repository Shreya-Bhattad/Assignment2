<user>
To empower our internal teams and accelerate content creation, we are launching a strategic initiative to develop an in-house, "No-Code" visual editor, codenamed "Aura".

The long-term vision is to provide teams like Marketing and Product with a tool that allows them to build and modify simple web layouts and promotional materials without direct engineering support.

I will share the requirements document once you are clear with the above application description. Ask me questions if any
</user>
<assistant>
Thank you for sharing the high-level description of "Aura". Before you provide the requirements document, here are a few clarifying questions to ensure I understand the scope and goals:

1. What platforms should Aura support (e.g., web only, desktop, mobile)?
2. Are there specific technologies or frameworks you prefer for development?
3. Will Aura need user authentication or team collaboration features?
4. Should the editor support exporting to specific formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)?
5. Are there any existing tools or competitors you want Aura to be inspired by or differentiated from?

Once you share the requirements document, I’ll be ready to proceed with analysis and implementation planning.
</assistant>
<user>

1. web only
2. frameworks will be discussed after requirements doc.
3. no
4. we can add this later
5. yes. You can refer

   Thank you for the clarifications and references. I’m ready to review the requirements document and proceed with analysis or planning as soon as you share it. Please upload or paste the requirements when ready.

   <user>
   create a .md file where I can add the requirements
   </user>
   <assistant>
   The file aura-requirements.md has been created in your workspace. You can now add your requirements for the Aura No-Code Visual Editor there. Let me know if you need any specific formatting or additional sections.
   </assistant>
   <user>
   I have added the requirements in the provided file. Read the requirements and ask me questions if any
   </user>
   <assistant>
   I have read your requirements for Aura. Here are a few clarifying questions before proceeding:

6. Should the initial implementation support only the four listed components (Text, TextArea, Image, Button), or do you expect more to be added soon?
7. For localStorage, should each user's work be auto-saved, or only on explicit action (e.g., Save button)?
8. Is there a preferred UI library (e.g., React, Vue, plain JS), or should I wait for your framework decision?
9. Should the editor support responsive design (e.g., mobile preview), or is desktop-only sufficient for now?
10. Are there any accessibility requirements (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)?
11. Is user authentication or multi-user collaboration out of scope for the MVP?

Let me know if you want to clarify or expand on any of these points before I proceed with planning or implementation steps.
